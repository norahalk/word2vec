# word2vec
word2vec is a technique for natural language processing (NLP).
The word2vec algorithm uses a neural network model to learn word associations from a large corpus of text.
Once trained, such a model can detect synonymous words or suggest additional words for a partial sentence.
This code implements word2vec using the Python language and the TensorFlow libarary.
